# A Desktop java software for M2M configuration for IOT applications
I wrote this java code to help people configure their Zigbee
devices and create new topologies
## Configure Zigbee and autonomous network mesh topology creation
The goal is to create the best topology such as a combination
of star and other topologies.
### Technologies
I used JavaFX to create this software to configure zigbee and 
raspberry pie devices. Remember that i only used Raspberry pie for 
wifi and is a hub to extend the bandwidth.
The applications of this software is for both M2M and IOT.
Please send me pull request to contribute to my library since it is
totally opensource and everybody can utilize my codes freely.
### Applications

<li> smart home
<li> industrial IOT for monitoring,fault detection,isolations and control of many pump,compressors,...
